Tools for managing LilyPond files and pdf music charts

## Included tools

- setlist.py to make setlists from a selection of pdf files. I use it to create a setlist from a set of music charts, but it can be used to join any set of pdf files into a single pdf file with a table of contents.
- chart_selector.py to find pdf files to add to the selection file
- fourbar.py to prints first four bars of a set of LilyPond files
- klezapp.pl to tranpose LilyPond files to Bb and Eb and bass clef, and send to google drive as a single combined pdf file

(setlist chart_selector and klezapp work, fourbar is still in development.)
